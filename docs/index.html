            <h1>Assignment 2: Gradient boosting and locally weighted logistic regression</h1>
            <h4>by Mary Deignan and Al Romero</h4>

            <h2>Gradient boosting</h2>
            <p>Gradient boosting is a method of training a model against its own residuals. We implemented this technique alongside a locally weighted regression (Lowess) class, which predicts based on the distance between points. Read the explanation <a href="part1.html">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Locally weighted logistic regression</h2>
            <p>Locally weighted logistic regression utilizes the previously written locally weighted regression class and implements a sigmoidal distribution to help with classification. Read the explanation <a href="part2.html">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Our implementations of both sections of the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/MaryEDeignan/Homework2/blob/main/HW2.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Group work distribution</h2>
            <p>Mary wrote the Logistic class, improved the GradientBooster class, created the boosting diagram visualization, and wrote the majority of the HW2.ipynb file.</p>
            <p>Al wrote the GradientBooster class, consolidated parts of the HW2.ipynb file, reviewed the Logistic class, and wrote the majority of the website.</p>
