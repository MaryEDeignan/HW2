        <h1>Locally Weighted Logistic Regression</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Locally weighted regression finds the weights of a small number of points at a time, based on the distance between a point and its neighbors.
            This strategy can be applied to classification as well as regression via logistic regression, which uses a sigmoid relationship to determine whether an individual data point belongs to a certain class.
            For more than one class, logistic regression requires the one-versus-many method, where the data is split into a single class and all the classes that are not that class.
        </p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>This part of the project was based off of our previous project, which just did locally weighted regression. We modified this class, using scikit-learn's Logistic Regression model, and set it to classify by one versus rest classification for each class in a given dataset.
            The model predicts the likelihood of a given point to be a part of a class for each class in the dataset, and then chooses the most likely class as its prediction for that data point.
